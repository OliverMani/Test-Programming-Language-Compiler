# Test-Programming-Language-Compiler
Hi, I'm writing my own programming language, I've only got started with some very basic things, like doing whatever you want to do with it thru `$syscall` function call. In testfile.txt, you can see how far I've gone with the compiler, what you can do in my programming language at this moment. My goal is to make a programming language with a very simple and easy-to-remember syntax that runs as fast as C/C++. Now, I'm writing my compiler in python, that what my compiler does right now, is converting your code in this language, into an assembly code, you can compile with the GNU assembler land their linker.
